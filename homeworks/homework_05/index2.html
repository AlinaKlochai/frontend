        <p>
            Pendulum is an Australian electronic rock band founded in 2002. Pendulum originally formed in the city of
            Perth, Western Australia, by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen and Paul "El Hornet" Harding.
            The band was later expanded to include members Ben Mount, Peredur ap Gwynedd and KJ Sawka. The group is
            notable for its distinctive sound, mixing electronic music with hard rock and covering a wide range of
            genres.

            Their debut studio album, Hold Your Colour, was released in 2005 to positive critical reception. While Hold
            Your Colour was mostly of the drum & bass genre, the succeeding albums In Silico and Immersion saw
            experimentation
            of other genres such as industrial rock and electronic rock.

            In August 2013, Swire announced that a new album may be released in 2014, although Swire and McGrillen later
            confessed on their Reddit AMA that they had become disillusioned with Pendulum and have no interest at
            present
            in producing any new material. Despite this, on 20 March 2016, Pendulum reunited to perform at the Ultra
            Music Festival in Miami, Florida, marking their official return as a live act. Soon after this, the band
            released
            the remix album The Reworks in 2018. The band have since released the EPs Elemental (2021) and Anima (2023).

            Pendulum began their career in Perth, Western Australia as a trio of DJs. Harding had been active in the Perth
            drum & bass scene for some time, DJing under the name "El Hornet". Swire and McGrillen had played friends parties,
            mainly DJing from their computers. Initially Swire and McGrillen wanted to start a record label and release songs
            on it. One evening they were meant to play a DJ set on The Perth Producers night at The Drumclub, but Swire's 
            hard drive failed.
